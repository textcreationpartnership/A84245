         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Many Townes of indifferent ſtrength wee have taken from the Rebells. Namely theſe,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Drogheda</hi> taken by Captaine <hi>Chriſtopher Lof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> with the loſſe of twenty five men, the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bells looſing neere three hundred.</p>

As for <hi>Lymrick,</hi> that was a place which did do much hurt to our proceedings, being ſo ſtrongly fortified by the Rebells, that though our <hi>Engliſh</hi> forces had made many at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts againſt it, yet they were repulſt, and forced to recreate as vanquiſhed.</p>
            <p>Nevertheleſſe ſo it pleaſed God to bleſſe us, that he put it into the heart of Captaine <hi>Bart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let,</hi>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:125714:3"/>a Scotch Commander, to frame a project, and to put that project in execution.</p>
            <p>For on ſatterday the 9th. of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> the ſaid Captaine <hi>Bartlet</hi> came to my Lord Lievte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant Generall, and deſired him that he would bee pleaſed to let him imploy five hundred men, and a troope of horſe, in a deſigne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Caſtle of <hi>Limrick,</hi> withall promiſing confidently, that hee would take the Caſtle, or upon the fayling thereof hee would looſe his head, the Lord Lievtenant being loath that a Commander of ſuch worth ſhould en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage himſelfe in a deſigne of ſuch probable danger, and improbable to proſper, uſed much perſwaſions, deſireing him to avert his inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſince an attempt upon that Caſtle ſo ſtrongly fortified muſt of neceſſity prove the ruine of him and his Company, withall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timating that if hee ſhould receive a defeat by the Rebells, and bee loſt in that deſigne, it would give an occaſion of incouragement to the Rebells, and bee a meanes to diſhearten the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> who were in great want of ſuch noble and well diſpoſed Commanders as himſelfe.</p>
            <pb n="6" facs="tcp:125714:4"/>
            <p> Notwithſtanding all this the ſaid Captaine <hi>Bartlet</hi> would not be perſwaded but that hee ſhould take the Caſtle, which the Lord Leivte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant ſeing, gave way to his deſire, withall gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving command that five hundred of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pereſt and forewardeſt men ſhould be aſſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for him, and ſir <hi>Richard Greenevills</hi> Troope of Horſe, which hee having received, marcht preſently away from the Army to a little vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage, which they had that day plundered, where hee cauſed them to ſearch for all the Trouſes and habits of the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> with which he habited one halfe of his men, making them appeare juſt like <hi>Iriſh</hi> Kemes, having ſo done, he out of that part of his men which remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed elected thirty muſquetiers which he placed, (being befriended by the darkneſſe of the night) on the backſide of the Caſtle in a deep ditch, giving them command not to ſtirre till they ſee the <hi>Iriſh</hi> forces out of the Caſtle. Likewiſe his troop of horſe he placed in a little grove, which was of one ſide of the Caſtle, ſome three Bowes ſhots off, having thus pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced his men, and giving them directions what they ſhould doe, hee ſent out thoſe that were
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:125714:4"/>habited like <hi>Iriſh</hi> men, to walke round the Caſtle, and to waite till that hee ſhould come up to charge the Caſtle.</p>
            <p>The day appearing Captain <hi>Bartlet</hi> led on his men and beat a feirce <hi>alarum,</hi> which the <hi>Iriſh</hi> in the Caſtle ſeeing, began ſtraight to arme them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, but on the ſudden they ſee the ſuppoſed <hi>Iriſh</hi> come to their reſcue, for the diſguiſed <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſeemed to charge Captaine <hi>Bartlet</hi> very fiercely, onely with powder to be ſhot, after a little time ſpent in this ſeemeing combate, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> falling down thicke and threefold, lying as if they were dead, and the reſt flying, which the Rebells ſeeing, ſtraight iſſued out of the Caſtle, purſuing the <hi>Engliſh</hi> that fled, not once noting or medling with thoſe that lay on the ground as dead.</p>
            <p>Which the 30. Maſquetiers ſeeing roſe, and with all ſpeed ſeiſed on the Caſtle, killing thoſe that were the guard, who were unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided of defence being overjoyed with their ſuppoſed victory.</p>
            <p>The Troope of horſe clapt in betweene them and the Caſtle and the ſuppoſed dead men roſe and charged them cutting them off
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:125714:5"/>without mercy, ſo that they at that time kild above 3. thouſand of the Rebells, and tooke many priſoners, not looſing above three men, only ſome few hurt, this is a reall truth, and the true manner of his taking the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle of <hi>Limrick,</hi> for which ſervice he is ſo admired, that the ſouldiers are greedy to goe with him upon the moſt deſperate deſignes.</p>
            <p>Thus it pleaſeth God to fight for us, and wee doubt not (were the preſent diſtractions of <hi>England</hi> once com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed) and more ayd ſent over, we ſhould quickly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce this Kingdome to its former obedience, and ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh all thoſe blood-thirſty <hi>Papiſts</hi> out of the Land.</p>
            <p>This is the ſumme of all that hath happened lately, or is worthy my paines or your knowledge.</p>
            <p>Onely I deſire you in requitall to retaine me the chiefe Heads of your proceedings in <hi>England,</hi> for now <hi>Engliſh</hi> newes is as much longed for here, as <hi>Iriſh</hi> newes was lately in <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I received a letter from <hi>Chichester,</hi> which informed me that my Lord Deputies ſonne was taken priſoner at <hi>Portſmouth,</hi> and ſent up to the Parliament, pray ſend me word whether it be true or otherwiſe.</p>
